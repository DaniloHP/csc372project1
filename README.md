# Overview
This program will show you your **publicly available** GitHub info. It
might also lightly roast your repositories.

# Installation
Simply download a precompiled binary from our [release](https://github.com/DaniloHP/csc372project1/releases/latest)
and run the program in a terminal. Plese read the warning in the release's description 
about your OS's security features. If you don't like downloading and running binaries or we didn't
build for your platform, you can always clone/download the source code from the
repo and try building it yourself. This will require installing
`cargo`, which is actually quite simple. Follow [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and, once `cargo` is installed, run
```
cargo run
```
in your terminal from anywhere within the cloned repository.

# Usage
This program takes no arguments. Simply run with with `cargo run` or
download one of our binaries and run it directly in the terminal.
Enter your GitHub username, and you will be prompted from there.
